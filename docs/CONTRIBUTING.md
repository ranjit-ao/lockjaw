All contributions must follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/ranjit-ao/lockjaw/blob/master/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md "CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md").

Contributing is pretty straightforward. All pull requests will be reviewed, but to make our job easier, please review your own code to ensure it compiles or displays correctly before submitting it. In-progress commits are also allowed, however please write a comment letting me know so I do not close the PR or merge it early.

Comments are encouraged to show updates on progress and discuss issues.
